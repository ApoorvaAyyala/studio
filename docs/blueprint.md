- Accent color: Bright red (#FF0000) for mines and flags to create high visibility.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a modern font, should be used for the counter and UI labels.
- Use pixel-art icons for mines and flags, keeping a simple and retro style.
- Arrange the game board as a grid, with the mine counter and reset button positioned above or below the grid.
- Simple animations for revealing cells and flagging mines, such as a quick fade-in or pop-up effect.
